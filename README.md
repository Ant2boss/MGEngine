# MGEngine
A console "addon"

I call it an addon because it doesn't do anything that the current console can't do. But finding these features can be fairly annoying, so I just grouped a bunch of these features in a relativley small package that makes these features easy to use.
Also it's a small "8-bit" graphics engine, which is also pretty cool.
